## hello

I am a Computer Science MSci (hons) graduate based in the UK.
I studied at the University of St Andrews from 2018-2023, graduating with First Class Honours.

This website serves as a portfolio with quick links to useful places.

My dissertation explored generative music. My other university work has involved vast amounts of coding in Java, Kotlin, Python and C. I also have experience in C++, Go, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript (Angular in particular), Haskell and Prolog.
